**Applied Econometrics**

This repo is my study notes in **Applied econometrics** Module at University of Exeter.

**Applied econometrics 1**

This module employs statistical methods to real-world data to give a quantitative description of the relationship amongst variables around us and a measure of how precise this description is. In this module, we will briefly review probability theory and fundamental statistics, which will cover topics like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. We will then proceed to regression analysis, which is the workhorse of applied econometrics. We will also attempt to cover more advanced topics in regression analysis such as, but not limited to, panel data methods and nonlinear functions.
